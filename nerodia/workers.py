"""
Contains the class definitions
for various workers that are
used by Nerodia, namely:

- The Reddit Consumer, which
waits for events in a queue
and passes them to their
designated handlers.

- The Reddit Producer, which
polls for reddit direct messages
in a set interval and puts them
into the event queue when necessary.

- The Twitch Producer, which polls
the Twtch API for stream updates.
Puts events for the stream going
online / offline into the event
queue when states change.

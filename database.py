"""
Database file. Contains the table
classes and relationships for
the Subreddit as well as the Stream
tables. Each subreddit can follow
0 - n streams, and each stream can
be folloed by 0 - n subreddits, thus
resulting in a many - to - many
relationship between the two tables.

By default, the database file is
created under the filename "nerodia.db"
in the directory in which the application
is run. If you wish to change this
behaviour, export an environment
variable named NERODIA_DB_PATH with
the full path towards the desired
database file location.

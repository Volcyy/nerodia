# Nerodia
A Reddit Bot that follows Twitch streams on a per-subreddit basis
and updates the subreddit's sidebar when a followed stream goes
online or offline.

### Setup
An [example configuration file](./config-example.json) is provided.
The following section explains how to obtain the various required tokens:

- `discord_auth | token`
You can obtain this by visiting [Discord - My Apps](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me),
creating a new app by clicking `New App`, and then after creating it, copying the `Token` from
`App Bot User` on the Bot page. Paste the token into the empty `""`, and the Discord Bot is set up.

- `reddit_auth`
For detailed information about authenticating via OAuth through PRAW, please read through
[Authenticating via OAuth from the PRAW docs](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html).
This should explain everything you need.
For determining a nice user agent, please read through the [Reddit API Rules](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API#rules).

- `twitch_auth | client_id`
For obtaining a client ID for using the Twitch API, click `Register your app` on the bottom of
the [Twitch Connections page](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections). You can simply
copy the `Client ID` from the application you created afterwards, and paste it into the empty `""`.

That's it for the authentication part.
Now, you need to install requirements. This is as simple as running
```sh
$ pipenv install --dev
```
After you installed the requirements, you can perform an additional configuration step
and change the environment variable `NERODIA_DB_PATH` to where ever you want the SQLite
database to house. This defaults to `./data/nerodia.db`.

The last step is migrating your database. You can do so by running `alembic upgrade head`.
